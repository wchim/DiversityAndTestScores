# Diversity and Test Scores
This is an extension of my first analytics project. 
The original project focused on looking into demographic and examination scoring data during the 2011-12 school year. 
The intention is to prove/disprove my hypothesis on whether diversity in student population correlates with better academic performance.

The extension will focus on demographic and examination scoring data during the 2017-2018 school year and explore new data visualization techniques that I learned since.

This will primarily focus on exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Content
This repository will include both the original project code for when I was a student in Baruch College's CIS 3120 course, which is instructed by professor Kannan Mohan. (Group members include: Haoxiang C., Amanda C., Ka Ren L.)

And of course, the extension project code.

## Constraints
The original project focused on the 2011-12 school year because of a lack in data availability for state ELA examination scores for any school year beyond. 

Recency is critical in assessing a school's current performance. While student demographic data is kept up to date, state math examination score data only goes to the 2017-18 school year.

Until I can find examination scores for other subjects, the extension will only use state math examination scores.
